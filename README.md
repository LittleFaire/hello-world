Hello friends!

LittleFaire speaking, learning how to make a new repository (whatever that means). I'm new here and never did this before. I was watching a free CS5 class from Harvard and they assign the viwers to come here. I'm crazy about games and that's why I want to move on with this CS5 course. I hope I can get to the end of it. But some of the language the teacher uses and even the websites are a little bit too technical. There's so much to remember!
